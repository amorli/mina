(** Transition state type.
    
    It contains all the available information about a transition which:

        b) is in the process of verification and addition to the frontier

    In case of transition being invalid, only the minimal informaton is stored.

    Transition state type is meant to be used for transitions that were received by gossip or
    that are ancestors of a transition received by gossip.
