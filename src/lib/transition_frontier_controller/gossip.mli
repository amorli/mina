(** Preserve body in the transition's state.
    
    Function is called when a gossip with a body is received or
    when a transition is retrieved through ancestry retrieval with a body
    (i.e. via using old RPCs).

    In case of [Transition_state.Downloading_body] state in [Substate.Failed] or
    [Substate.Processing (Substate.In_progress _)] statuses, status is changed
    to [Substate.Processing (Substate.Done _)] and [`Mark_downloading_body_processed]
    hint is returned. Returned hint is [`Nop] otherwise.

(** [preserve_relevant_gossip] takes data of a recently received gossip related to a
    transition already present in the catchup state. It preserves useful data of gossip
    in the catchup state.
    
    Function returns a pair of a new transition state and a hint of further action to be
    performed in case the gossiped data triggering a change of state.
